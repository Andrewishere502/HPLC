### TODO ###
get chemmeta.csv via collab with Jacob


If this is program is gonna be used for future years:
- add more error catching and logging
- add a readme.txt, hopefully should be simple but still necessary
- CLEAN COMMENTS and docstrings
- Compartamentalize the code more, this procedural stuff is so freaking gross
- Write plenty of doctests
